### 🔬 Research & Interests

I am an undergraduate researcher dedicated to advancing the capabilities of Large Language Models. My goal is to make LLMs more efficient, knowledgeable, and free from hallucinations.

* [cite_start]**Efficient LLM Inference**: I have experience researching and developing methods for efficient LLM inference, including on-device solutions, at **KAIST's Network and Mobile System Laboratory**[cite: 10, 12].
* [cite_start]**Mitigating Hallucination**: At **Korea University's Data Mining Information Systems Laboratory**, my work has centered on enhancing LLM knowledge and developing schemes to mitigate hallucinations, particularly in the biomedical domain for drug discovery[cite: 13, 15].
